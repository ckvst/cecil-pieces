    <h2>Crown</h2>
    <p>
      Crown. Who is worthy of a crown?<br>
      A true Queen is worthy of a crown.<br>
      Crowned right from inception and been a Queen since.<br>
      Limerance? No! True love for one who is worthy of the crown.<br>
      A Queen worth my admiration, my one true Queen.<br>
      <br><br>
      A Queen, a beautiful young lady crowned in grace.<br>
      Her crown is majestic, fitting for her and all her majesty <br>
      Her eyes are pretty, unique as her crown and lovely as her skin<br>
      Her smile is charming, her laugh is contagious<br>
      Her walk is elegant, her talk is sweet and her voice, the sweetest<br>
      Her heart is pure, her soul is golden and her mind is sharp<br>
      Her presence is magnetic, her aura is divine and her vibe is heavenly<br>
      The only worthy of my love<br>
      The only worthy of my crown<br>
