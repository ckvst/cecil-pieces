    <h2>The Man Meant to Be</h2>
    <p>
        Ruthless as it may seem<br>
        It was all a scheme to undermine<br>
        You can't, foolish, bastard<br>
        All words to tear down the man<br>
        The man meant to become<br>
        True strength is in pain<br>
        Purpose from the Lord Almighty<br>
        But it was all meant to happen<br>
        To harden the man through pain<br>
        Slowly it would come to fore<br>
        That the man has truly become<br>
        What they feared he can be<br>
        What he never thought he'd be<br>
        The man meant to be<br>
