      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Cecil. A young aspiring writer who finds peace in writing thoughts I treasure, my poetic pieces.
        Writing wasn't a part of my plans growing up, but as I grew older, I found myself writing more and more.
        I aspired to be a petroleum engineer, God being so good, he gave me a chance to study petroleum engineering in the university
        and already I'm approaching my third year. It's been tough from my first semester in the university all through
        to my fourth semester. There were days where the only thing I felt was easy to do was putting my thoughts down.
        Other days, I'll stop by the basketball court to play a game or two with friends, and other days I'll just stay in my room
        and watch movies, but when every other thing was immpossible, putting my thoughts down in my journal wasn't a struggle.
        It's now a part of me, and I can't wait to share my pieces with the world.   
        <br><br>
        “Cecil's Pieces” is my safe space, my space to document my pieces and freely put down my thoughts to readers 
        around the world. My space to inspire individuals who aspire to write and let their voices be heard. Welcome!
